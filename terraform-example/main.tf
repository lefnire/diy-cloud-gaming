  # This is important! If spot_price is null, it will create an on-demand EC2 instance. This is more expensive, but more stable. Spot instances
  # can save you up to 90% on-demand prices; but they can be pulled out from under you (killing your gaming session). It's a bidding model, the 
  # higher your bid, the more likely you are to keep your instance online. I suggest setting the price higher than the price of the on-demand instance
  # ($2 instead of $1.5 in this case). So MOST of the time you'll be at the cost-saving; but when demand is pushing you, your high-bid is likely
  # to keep you online. Set this to null (or don't include it) if you don't ever want a gaming session killed; and you're willing to pay a premium
  # for that. Set it to a number if you're willing to have sessions killed, with the benefit of $$$ savings.
